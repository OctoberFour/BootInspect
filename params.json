The objective was to give a visual outline and labeling of what column sizes are happening at different screen sizes. This helps debug and sort out building layouts with Bootstrap. In particular it proves its worth when mixing in push, pull and offset.\r\n\r\nWho\r\n==============\r\nBootInspect is the product of [Patrick McNeil](http://pmcneil.com). The creator of [Design Meltdown](http://designmeltdown.com). \r\n\r\njQuery\r\n===========\r\nBootInspect requires that you have jQuery running on the page. I am sure it could easily be adapted to not need it.. However, since this isn't something you leave in a site I went for simplicity of creating it in place of creating a self sustaining utility.  Besides, jQuery and Bootstrap go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n===========\r\nDownload the CSS and JS file and attach them to your page.\r\n\r\nOr, simply loaded the GitHub hosted files into your page with this snippet (this is a hacky approach - but great for quick debugging):\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/designmeltdown/BootInspect/master/bootinspect.css\"> \r\n<script src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/designmeltdown/BootInspect/master/bootinspect.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: BootInspect requires jQuery. Be sure to attach the JS file to your page after your jQuery reference.\r\n\r\nSimply remove the CSS and JS file when you are done building your page.\r\n\r\nDemonstrations\r\n==================\r\nSeeing what this does is probably even more helpful:\r\n\r\n![Basic Columns](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2159602/4706254/2b8ec640-5883-11e4-8214-776f399f8892.jpg)\r\nHere you can see that BootInspect has outlined containers in blue, rows in red and columns in green. It uses CSS outlines so as to not mess up the spacing of things. Also you will notice it has labeled the columns to indicate which size column it is!\r\n\r\n![Basic Columns](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2159602/4706254/2b8ec640-5883-11e4-8214-776f399f8892.jpg)\r\nNote that the XS column is rendered in white while the medium ones are orange. This is because the current display size is medium. So all inherited col sizes are white, while the ones targeting the current size are yellow. If this browser were sized up to be large, the medium ones would turn white. Note, the orange tags are covering up any sm or xs col sizes they override.\r\n\r\n![Smaller screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2159602/4706256/2b92d456-5883-11e4-9f3c-ba81e80d39ef.jpg)\r\nHere the same design is shown with a smaller screen size in the small range. Note the purple color used to indicate sm columns.\r\n\r\n![Helpful for debugging](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2159602/4706255/2b9151b2-5883-11e4-80cd-62f397a0e317.jpg)\r\nIn this screenshot you can see how it was helpful to debug. I was using push/pull to swap the two columns of content on larger screens in the white band of content. It was confusing where the columns start and end. With BootInspect on it was obvious that the first column was being pulled over one column too far. \r\n\r\n![Nested rows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2159602/4706253/2b8a9cd2-5883-11e4-8d96-6451dcb274dd.jpg)\r\nBootInspect roughly handles nested rows (1 layer deep at this time). It moves the nested column labels to the left. In this sample you can see the first column is nested. The outer one is set to col-md-4 while the inner ones are set to col-md-12. \r\n\r\nBootLint\r\n===================\r\nThis tool is not meant to replace [BootLint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint). I find that the two work really well together.\r\n\r\nRelease History\r\n==============\r\n* 2014/10/20 - First formal release in preperation for use at Future of Web Deisgn NYC\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n==============\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Patrick McNeil.
